Alarm Clock
===========

Continuing work on this will be done on (https://github.com/stvedt/alarm-clock)

## Next Steps to continue building out

- Continue searching for better alarm setting solution that is easier than a dropdown. (Text inputs considered)
- Build out the capability for setting multiple alarms which was started by storing into an array.
- Add functionality to toggle between 12/24 hour clock.
- Use localStorage to save the alarm(s) so alarms are set even after reload.
- Provide visual cue that an alarm is set.
- I would like to further expose some of my methods for functions like `setAlarm`.
- A continuation of the previous item is the creation of a configuration object to allow passing of DOM elements too. That would allow the application to be more separated from the DOM so others can use this application with DOM elements of their own.
